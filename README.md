Time Series Analysis of Historical Stock Prices

Overview:
This project performs time series analysis on historical stock prices using Python. The objective is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights from the temporal data, enabling a better understanding of stock price movements over time.

Dataset:
The historical stock price data is fetched from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library. You can specify the ticker symbol of the stock (`ticker_symbol`), as well as the start and end dates for the historical data (`start_date` and `end_date`). In this example, the historical stock prices for Apple Inc. (`AAPL`) from January 1, 2020, to January 1, 2022, are analyzed.

Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
3. Adjust the `ticker_symbol`, `start_date`, and `end_date` variables in the code to analyze different stocks or different time periods.
4. Run the Python script to fetch the historical stock price data and perform time series analysis.
5. Explore the results, including visualizations of stock prices over time, to uncover patterns and trends.
